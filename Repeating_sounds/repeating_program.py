Sound Repetition
Author: Al Sweigart (al@inventwithpython.com)

A memory game with sounds, where the player must remember increasingly longer sequences of letters. 
The player has to correctly repeat the sequences generated by the program, which are both visual and auditory. 
Each new round adds another element to the sequence, increasing the level of difficulty.

The game is inspired by the popular electronic toy Simon, known for its challenges of repeating growing sequences of colors and sounds. 
This program offers a great way to exercise memory and concentration.
